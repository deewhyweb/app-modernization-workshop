As this is a tomcat application, weâ€™re going to uncheck the EAP
migration path

*_Uncheck the EAP migration path_*

We will focus on containerizing the application. Since this is going to
be a linux container, it makes sense to do a sanity check to avoid and
Windows paths might remain in the code from previous iterations. We also
going to investigate removing reliance on proprietary JDK licenses, so
we going to select OpenJDK as a target.

*_Check Containers, Linux, and OpenJDK as the targets_*
